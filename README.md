# Fabric-dist

The production build of the [FabricJS](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js) npm library.

The main purpose is to avoid compilation errors in case where you just want to use bundled JS version of the package.

`npm i --save fabric-dist`

If you want to see what's changed in particular version, please go to the original [Changelog](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the FabricJS.

If there is a new version of the original Fabric and there is no bundled version of it yet, please shout to me and I will publish a new version for you :)
